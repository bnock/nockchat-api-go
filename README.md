# nockchat-api-go
The NockChat API in Go

## Database
This project relies on the [Golang Migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate) library's CLI.  Installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/tree/master/cmd/migrate#installation).

I plan to include a *Makefile* for common migration commands when I have time.
